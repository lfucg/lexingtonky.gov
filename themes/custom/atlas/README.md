# Atlas is a starter theme for Drupal 8

This starter theme is a companion to a [series of articles](https://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/drupal-8-theming-fundamentals-part-1) on Lullabot.com.

Some of the examples from the articles have been modified slightly to provide more sensible defaults for those who would like to use Atlas as a starting point for their own work.

##Installation
This theme uses [Libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass) to compile Sass files. Libsass can be easily installed on [Macs](https://github.com/sass/libsass/wiki/Building-on-Mac-OS-X) and is also available for [Windows](https://github.com/sass/libsass/wiki/Building-on-Windows). You should make sure you have Libsass installed before you proceed.

Next, install dependencies using npm by running the following command in the root of your theme folder:

`npm install`

There are a number of Gulp commands available. To compile your Sass, and minify images run:

`gulp build`

You can also watch for any changes to your files by running:

`gulp watch`

If you simply run `gulp` it is the same as running the build and watch commands in succession.

**Important Note:** The CSS file in libraries.yml is set to styles.css. This file is not minified and includes Sass maps for debugging. Before pushing your code to production, you should change libraries.yml so that it is set to styles.min.css. This file is automatically generated when you run `gulp build` and should already be available  for you to use.
