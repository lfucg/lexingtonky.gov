INTRODUCTION
============

Browsersync helps you integrate the Browsersync Node.js module
(http://browsersync.io/) with your Drupal site by including the required
JavaScript snippet into your website, just before the closing </body> tag.

Please note that this module DOES NOT run Browsersync for you. You will still
need to run it from the command line using one of the following methods:

 * Browsersync Command Line Usage (http://www.browsersync.io/docs/command-line/)
 * Browsersync + Gulp.js (http://www.browsersync.io/docs/gulp/)
 * Browsersync + Grunt.js (http://www.browsersync.io/docs/grunt/)


CONFIGURATION
============

Configuration options are found on the settings page for the theme you wish to
use it on.

 1. Go to Appearance > Settings > { YOUR THEME }
 2. Tick "Enable Browsersync"
 3. Optionally, add the server information
