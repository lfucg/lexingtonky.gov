 * @{
 * A basic example of defining a content type through configuration YAML files.
 *
 * In this example we create two content types for Drupal 8, using only YAML
 * files. Well, mostly only YAML files... One of our content types is locked,
 * so the user can't delete it while the module is installed. For this we need
 * a very tiny amount of support code.
 *
 * The simplest way to author the per-type YAML files is to create the content
 * types within Drupal and then take the YAML files from the configuration
 * directory. Like this:
 *
 * - Install Drupal 8.
 * - Create a new content type at admin/structure/types/add. Let's call it
 *   'Nifty Content Type'.
 * - Look in sites/default/files/config_[some hex codes]/active/. You'll see
 *   a file called node.type.nifty_content_type.yml.
 * - Copy or move that file to your module's config/ directory.
 *
 * You can see two of these YAML files in this module's config/ directory.
 *
 * If you want to lock a content type created in this way, you'll have to
 * implement hook_install() and hook_uninstall(). In hook_install(), you'll
 * set the content type to be locked. In hook_uninstall() you'll set the
 * content type to be unlocked.
 *
 * Content types created in this way will remain available after the user has
 * uninstalled the module. If you were to fail to set the content type as
 * unlocked, the user would not be able to delete it.
