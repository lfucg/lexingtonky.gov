 * Example of how to use Drupal's mail API.
 *
 * This example module provides two different examples of the Drupal email API:
 *  - Defines a simple contact form and shows how to use MailManager::mail()
 *    to send an e-mail (defined in hook_mail()) when the form is submitted.
 *  - Shows how modules can alter emails defined by other Drupal modules or
 *    core using hook_mail_alter by attaching a custom signature before
 *    they are sent.
 */

/**
 * Implements hook_mail().
 *
 * This hook defines a list of possible e-mail templates that this module can
 * send. Each e-mail is given a unique identifier, or 'key'.
 *
 * $message comes in with some standard properties already set: 'to' address,
 * 'from' address, and a set of default 'headers' from MailManager::mail(). The
 * goal of hook_mail() is to set the message's 'subject' and 'body' properties,
 * as well as make any adjustments to the headers that are necessary.
 *
 * The $params argument is an array which can hold any additional data required
 * to build the mail subject and body; for example, user-entered form data, or
 * some context information as to where the mail request came from.
 *
 * Note that hook_mail() is not actually a hook. It is only called for a single
 * module, the module named in the first argument of MailManager::mail(). So
 * it's a callback of a type, but not a hook.
