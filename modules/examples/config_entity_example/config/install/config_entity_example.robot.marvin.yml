# This file defines a default config entity. This allows the module to include
# config entities that are present 'out of the box'. Default config entities
# are created in Drupal when the module is enabled. They are removed when the
# module is uninstalled.

# Default config entities can be edited by the user within Drupal. This edited
# entity wil become exportable through the configuration system. This file,
# however, will remain untouched.

# For our config entity to be added at installation time, we have to place it in
# the config/install directory of our module. Thus our file is located at:
# config/install/config_entity_example.robot.marvin.yml.

# You can see where these properties are defined in the annotation of
# Drupal\config_entity_example\Entity\Robot.

# The id of the config entity.
id: marvin
# Our properties follow.
