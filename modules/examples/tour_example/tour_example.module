 * The Tour module allows you you make instructional tours of user interfaces.
 *
 * The Tour module comes with Drupal 8 and makes it easy for developers to add
 * "Tours" for guiding users through unfamiliar user interfaces.
 *
 * Each tour is comprised of a series of tooltips that provide contextual
 * information about an interface. The user can start a tour by clicking the
 * "Tour" icon on the right side of the Drupal 8 toolbar. The tour icon is only
 * visible when there is a tour available on the current page.
 *
 * The Tour module provides the Tour API, which makes it easy for developers to
 * add tours to their modules. In most cases, adding a tour is as simple as
 * creating a YAML file in the config directory in their module, containing the
 * expected data. For a detailed example of such a file, see
 * config/tour.tour.tour-example.yml.
 *
 * If you are interested in building tours through a user interface, you may
 * want to look at the Tour UI module: https://drupal.org/project/tour_ui
 *
 * The Tour module uses the Joyride jQuery plugin for its underlying
 * functionality. You can find more information about Joyride at
 * https://github.com/zurb/joyride
