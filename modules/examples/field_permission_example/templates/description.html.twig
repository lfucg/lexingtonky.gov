  <p>The Field Permission Example module shows how you can restrict view and edit permissions
  within your field implementation. It adds a new field type called Fieldnote. Fieldnotes
  appear as simple text boxes on the create/edit form, and as sticky notes when viewed.
  By 'sticky note' we mean 'Post-It Note' but that's a trademarked term.</p>

  <p>To see this field in action, add it to a content type or user profile. Go to the
  permissions page ({{admin_link}}) and look at the 'Field Permission Example' section. This
  allows you to change which roles can see and edit Fieldnote fields.</p>

  <p>Creating different users with different capabilities will let you see these behaviors
  in action. Fieldnote helpfully displays a message telling you which permissions it is
  trying to resolve for the current field/user combination.</p>

  <p>Definitely look through the code to see various implementation details.</p>
