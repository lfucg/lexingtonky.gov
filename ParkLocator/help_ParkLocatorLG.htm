        <h1>How to use the Park and Recreation Locator</h1>
	    <p>The <b>Park and Recreation Locator</b> application helps citizens locate a park and obtain information about recreation activities in their community.  This application is typically used by residents within a Local Government, but can be used by visitors to locate a park or recreation area near them, or one that offers the activity they are interested in.<br/> <br/>To locate a park, simply enter an address, or park name in the search box or select activities.  Or, you can use your current location to find a park near you.  The park(s) or recreation area(s) will then be highlighted on the map and relevant information about available recreation activities presented to you.</p>
	    <h3><u>Using the Application</u></h3>
	    <p>The Park and Recreation Locator application provides residents and visitors an easy way to find parks near them, a park by it's name, or recreation opportunities offered in parks within the Local Government.  Enter your address or click on the Current Location button to find parks near you.  If you click the Current Location button, it will use the location of your computer's IP address or your cell phone/tablet location to locate parks near you. When you enter an address or use your current location, the application will present a list of parks near you and allow you to review relevant information about each park.  In addition, you can search for a park, or specific recreation activity you'd like to undertake, by name.  To do that, enter the name of the park in the search box.
