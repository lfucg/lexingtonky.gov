Feature: Display board/commission page

# @javascript
# Scenario: Filtering boards in the department directory
#   Given I am on "/browse/government"
#   # make sure js boards directory initializes when loaded via ajax
#   And I click "Boards and commissions"
#   And I wait for AJAX to finish
#   Then I should see "Planning Commission"
#
#   When I fill in "Type the name of a board" with "Corridors"
#   Then I should not see "Planning Commission"
#   And I should see "Corridors Commission" in the content region
